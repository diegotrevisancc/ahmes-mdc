## Project Overview
This project is designed for the pseudocomputer AHMES, a creation of academic teachers from the Universidade do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), namely Raul Fernando Weber (in memoriam) and Taisy Silva Weber. The purpose of this project is to calculate the Maximum Common Divisor (MCD) between two numbers.

### Purpose
The primary goal of this code is to compute the MCD of two given numbers. This is an example of very low-level programming.

## Usage Guide
1. Download AHMES from [here](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/arq/wiki/doku.php?id=ahmes).
2. Import the provided code.
3. Input the first number (A) into data space 254.
4. Input the second number (B) into data space 255.
5. Execute the program.
6. The result will be displayed in the Accumulator.
